        <h3 contenteditable="true">Top Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li contenteditable="true">Skill 1 - Add a brief explanation to provide context and show the depth of your expertise</li>
            <li contenteditable="true">Skill 2 - This helps recruiter believe that you have the skills and aren't just stuffing your resume with empty keywords. For example:</li>
            <li contenteditable="true">CRM 4+ years leveraging Salesforce on a daily basis. Earned Salesforce Certification in January 2017. Additional experience with Pipedrive (1 year) and Highrise (6 months).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 contenteditable="true">Work Experience</h3>
        <div class="work-experience">
            <h4 contenteditable="true">Company 4, Location</h4>
            <p contenteditable="true">Job Title  MM/YYYY-Present</p>
            <p contenteditable="true">Tailor your experience sections to the job description. Don't use up too much of your space detailing daily duties that aren’t relevant to the job for which you're applying. Study the job listing to figure out what's most important to the hiring manager. Use important resume keywords and accomplishments that speak to your ability to execute.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-experience">
            <h4 contenteditable="true">Company 3, Location</h4>
            <p contenteditable="true">Job Title  MM/YYYY-Present</p>
            <p contenteditable="true">Work the hard skills and keywords found in the job description right into your resume. Continue to add context that proves that you actually possess the skill. For example, if you mention a piece of software like Excel, Photoshop, or AutoCAD, mention the types of projects it was used for.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-experience">
            <h4 contenteditable="true">Company 2, Location</h4>
            <p contenteditable="true">Job Title  MM/YYYY-Present</p>
            <p contenteditable="true">Recruiters like to be able to get an idea of why you move from company to company. Demonstrating your increasing impact and responsibility from job to job shows the recruiter that you're capable of taking on more and more and gives them an idea of where your career is heading.</p>

        <div class="work-experience">
            <h4 contenteditable="true">Company 1, Location</h4>
            <p contenteditable="true">Job Title  MM/YYYY-Present</p>
            <p contenteditable="true">You don't need to include every job you've ever had on your resume. Stick to the jobs that are most relevant and demonstrate your career trajectory. For example, if you are a Project Manager, you probably don't need to mention the supermarket job you had as a teenager.</p>
